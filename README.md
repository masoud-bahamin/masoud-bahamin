# üí´ About Me:
I'm a passionate front-end web developer with a track record of crafting engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. With over three years of experience in the world of web development, I've had the pleasure of honing my skills and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of the web.<br>My journey began with a dive into HTML and CSS, where I mastered the art of structuring content and styling it to perfection. Along the way, I embraced the power of JavaScript, allowing me to breathe life into web applications and create interactive, dynamic user interfaces.<br>Over last two years, I've immersed myself in the React ecosystem, working on several large-scale projects that challenged me to think critically and innovate. React has become my go-to framework for building efficient, modular, and maintainable web applications. I've also become proficient in utilizing popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap to streamline the design and development process.<br>Recently, I've embraced TypeScript as a valuable addition to my toolkit, enhancing code quality and making collaboration smoother. You can find my TypeScript projects, along with the rest of my work, on my GitHub profile.<br>I'm deeply passionate about web development, and I'm always excited to take on new challenges and stay up-to-date with emerging technologies.
